**Abstract:**

Development of advanced prosthetic limbs is a continuously evolving field aiming to restore function and improve quality of life for individuals with upper-limb amputations. This research explores the integration of mind-control interfaces with sensory feedback mechanisms in a bionic arm. The focus lies on creating a prosthesis that can be intuitively controlled through brain signals while simultaneously providing the user with a sense of touch.

**Introduction:**

Upper-limb amputations pose significant challenges for daily activities. Traditional prosthetics can restore some degree of function, but often lack intuitive control and sensory feedback. This research addresses these limitations by investigating the development of a mind-controlled bionic arm with restored sense of touch.

**Methodology:**

The research will explore two main areas:

1. **Mind-Control Interface:** Different BCI techniques will be evaluated, such as electroencephalography (EEG) or implanted electrodes, to identify the most effective method for capturing and interpreting brain signals related to arm movement intent.
2. **Sensory Feedback Integration:**  Sensors embedded in the bionic arm will detect touch information (pressure, texture). This information will be processed and converted into electrical signals that can be delivered to the user's nervous system through implanted electrodes or non-invasive stimulation techniques, creating a sense of touch in the prosthetic limb.

**Expected Outcomes:**

The successful development of this mind-controlled bionic arm with restored sense of touch could lead to significant improvements for individuals with upper-limb amputations. Potential benefits include:

* Enhanced dexterity and control of the prosthetic limb
* Improved ability to perform daily tasks
* Increased user satisfaction and quality of life
* Restoration of a more natural sense of body image

**Significance:**

This research contributes to the advancement of prosthetic technology by offering a more intuitive and immersive experience for users. By incorporating mind-control and sensory feedback, this bionic arm has the potential to revolutionize the field of upper-limb prosthetics.
